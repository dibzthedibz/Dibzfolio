I've always had an interest in mechanics and construction.  Building things and 

taking things apart.  When I went to my first music festival in 2012,

I realized that this was an industry where I could build skills in both areas, 

have some fun while I was young, and travel to expose myself to a larger group 

of cultures and people.

After three years of efforts, including quitting my job in the dairy aisle to 

get a job on Campus where I was more likely to have networking opportunities,

I made good friends with a local group of promoters and event coordinators.  

I volunteered my services with them, and eventually got offered a position to

be part of a new Site Operations team at a long running and very successful 

event in Central Illinois.  This event offered no housing in the contract, some

we slept in tents for 3 months, building an event on a 100+ acre site, with over 20,000

expected in attendance.  I was offered contracts at this event for three years before I 

eventually moved on, and went from a general hand my first year, to managing the entire 

department in my third year.

The next two years consisted of me using every bit of money I got from my paid gigs

for busfare to a volunteer gig wherever I could find cheap tickets to.  This networking

paid off; my third year of working festivals, I had more contract offers than I could

reasonably take on, for exciting, new, smaller events where I could take on more responsibility

and really practice my leadership skills.  I often had groups of 5-30 volunteers assigned to my department,

as well as anywhere from 2-30 individuals taking direction from me, depending on the size of the event.
