I held various retail positions and temporary jobs in my late teens and early twenties, 

but eventually I started helping Al Goetz, an old friend of my family, organize local 

auctions. The work consisted of going into a building, whether its an old farmhouse or an office

that has been shutdown, and organize everything of value into their most profitable groupings.

I learned quite a bit about old tools and antiques, and working on a team with sometimes random people

really instilled in me an interest to practice and hone my leadership and teamwork skills.
