I began working at the age of 14, at a local Amusement Park called Indiana Beach.  
I slung up hot dogs, italian beef, and tubeshaped icy treats for two summers there, 
and while it is a distant memory at this point in my life, it really set the stage 
for the type of environment I would find to be most productive and enjoyable.
